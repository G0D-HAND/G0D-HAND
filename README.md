God or demon, what am I?
It's time for me to choose my path.
The power of my God Hand;
no evil-doer will get past.
Hand to hand or fist to fist.
Kick your nuts or twist your wrist.
God power keeps my pimp hand strong
so trust me or you won't last very long.

Dragon Kick your ass into the Milky Way!
Don't act like you don't like the Ball Buster!
Mya mya mya mya mya mya
I summon up the powers of the God Hand!

Lost a limb in a fight,
but don't worry babe I'll be cool.
The ultimate power of a god
is now my secret tool.
My defenses are impregnable.
My style is impetuous.
If it's too much to grovel at your feet,
I'd beg for mercy when I feel the heat.

Jaw-dropping attacks from my roulette wheel
Apocolyptic beatdowns from the God Hand.
Mya mya mya mya mya mya
I summon up the powers of the God Hand!

Everybody wants a piece.
Who's next? Don't be a fool.
Hyperactive fighting style
so slick it'll make you drool.
The God Hand helps me work out my stress.
It's overpowering I must confess.
The only person it doesn't work on
is the girl who got me into this, Olivia.

Slicing through thugs with my Shockwave!
More beheading than a guillotine, Headslicer!
Mya mya mya mya mya mya
I summon up the powers of the God Hand!
