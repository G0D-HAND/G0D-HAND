God or demon? What am I?
It's time for me to choose my path
The power of my god hand
No evil doer will get past
Hand or hand or fist to fist
Kick your nuts off twist your wrist
The god power keeps my pimp hand strong
So trust me all you won't last very long
Dragon kick your ass into the milky way (milky way!)
Don't act like you don't like the ball buster (ball buster!)
My Arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm
I'll summon up the power of the God Hand!
Lost a limb in a fight
But don't worry babe
I'll be cool
The ultimate power of a god
Is now my secret tool
My defenses are impregnable
My style is impetuous
If it's too much
I'll grovel at your feet
I beg for mercy when
I feel the heat
Jaw dropping attacks from my roulette wheel (roulette wheel!)
Apocalyptic beat downs from the god hand (god hand!)
My Arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm
I'll summon up the power of the God Hand!
Everybody wants a piece
Who's next? Don't be a fool
Hyperactive fighting styles
So slick they will make you drool
The God Hand helps me work out my stress
It's overpowering
I must confess
The only person who it doesn't work on
Is the girl who got me into this Olivia
Slicing through thugs with my shockwave (shockwave!)
More beheading than a guillotine, head slicer (head slicer!)
My Arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm, my arm
I'll summon up the power of the God Hand!
